# MidiMatlab
A midi manipulation code written with Matlab. Most of the credit for the code goes to http://kenschutte.com/midi

- Code
Run the example.m. 

Most of the code is explained with comments in the code. 

Later on you could try running the chords.m files. In there still random notes are being played but if 'do', 'mi', 'sol' is played, a whole chord is played. So with 'do' comes 'mi' and 'sol'. Moreover, with 'mi' comes 'sol' and 'do' (upper octave). And last, with 'sol' comes 'do' (upper octave) & 'mi' (upper octave).
